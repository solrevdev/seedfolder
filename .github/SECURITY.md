# Security Policy

I have tried to keep this library and sample projects as secure as possible but I may have missed something or not
understood a vulnerability.

Advice, pull requests or disclosures will be appreciated.


## Reporting a Vulnerability

Feel free to raise an issue here on GitHub or you can get hold of me [@solrevdev](https://www.twitter.com/solrevdev) on Twitter or just email [john@solrevdev.com](mailto:john@solrevdev.com)

I am no security expert so please do be patient!
